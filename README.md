# Process Scheduling
I worked on this project as a part of the course Operating Systems during my undergraduation at NITK. 
Many algorithms exist to schedule processes in the computer. 
This project is aimed to illustrate the working of all the processes using UI. 
The project takes input from the user and prints the total response time and gantt chart. 

Overall, this project helped me to understand how various corner cases are handled.
